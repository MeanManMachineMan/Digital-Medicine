# Indian Demographic Projections for 2050
This repository contains the Jupyter notebook required to run the demographic projections as well as visulizaions. Simply run the notebook in GitHub or if that's not working, then clone this repo and run 'jupyter-notebook' through the terminal after navigating to the repo's directory and click on regression.ipynb to run the notebook.
